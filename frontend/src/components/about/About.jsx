      <p>
        Have you ever been in this situation? You want Pho, but with the love
        and care of a personal cook. You can't go to just any restaurant to get
        that, but you don't have someone you know that can create it either. You
        know what you do have? HomeCooked. The home food delivery service
        created for home cooks. Not only are you supporting your local
        community, but you're getting a great experience as well. It is a play
        on popular food delivery services, but for home cooks!
